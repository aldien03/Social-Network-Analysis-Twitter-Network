# Learn By Building Social Network Analysis

Choose one case and create a report using social network analysis method from Twitter data. The main goal of your case must be identify important person in the network and visualize the network:

- Analyze *Ego Network* from specific account/user    
- Analyze *Information Activity Network* from something that goes viral
- Analyze *Competition Network* from various account in the same industry

**Deadline: 5 June 2020**   
Submit: HTML / Rmd file to my trello card "LBB Submission: SNA Twitter"

The rubrics for the LBB are as follows:
This is a free-roam task, you can do whatever you want about your analysis. The most important things to do is identify important user and visualization. The internet have a lot of different view about how to do SNA. In general, you can do this on your analysis:
## Collect Data
- Do you use Twitter API authentication to collect the data? if yes, how do you activate it?

## Case 1: Ego network
Network:
- What account you want to analyze and why? give short explanation about your case and goals
- How do you collect the data?
- Do you need to filter the account to active account only? if yes, explain your 'criteria'
- How do you prepare the raw data (data gathered from Twitter API) into network data?
- Do you specify network type (directed and undirected) when you building the network?
- What algorithm do you use to create network community? do you compare it to another algorithm?
- What centrality do you calculate in your network?
- How do you identify the key player? give short explanation about your analysis     
Visualization:   
- What packages do you use for visualizing the network?
- Do you filter the network before visualizing? give short explanation why you did that
- Do you make sure your 'ego' account is presence in your visualization?
- What layout do you use for visualizing?
- What insight you can get from your visualization

## Case 2: Activity Network
Network:
- What keyword/hashtag you want to analyze and why? give short explanation about your case and goals
- How do you collect the data?
- Do you need to filter the data to specific time only? why?
- How do you prepare the raw data (data gathered from Twitter API) into network data?
- Do you specify network type (directed and undirected) when you building the network?
- What algorithm do you use to create network community? do you compare it to another algorithm?
- What centrality do you calculate in your network?
- How do you identify the key player? give short explanation about your analysis     
Visualization:     
- What packages do you use for visualizing the network?
- Do you filter the network before visualizing? give short explanation why you did that
- Do you seperate the interaction type by color/shape/anything ?
- What layout do you use for visualizing?
- What insight you can get from your visualization?

## Case 3: Competition Network
Network:
- What industry, account and how many account you want to analyze? give short explanation about your case and goals
- How do you collect the data? do you use any trick to shorten the time consumption?
- Do you need to filter something?
- How do you prepare the raw data (data gathered from Twitter API) into network data?
- Do you specify network type (directed and undirected) when you building the network?
- What algorithm do you use to create network community? do you compare it to another algorithm?
- What centrality do you calculate in your network?
- Is there any unique characteristic in every community?
- How do you identify the key player? give short explanation about your analysis    
Visualization:     
- What packages do you use for visualizing the network?
- How do you manage to visualize such a big network?
- Do you filter the network before visualizing? give short explanation why you did that
- What layout do you use for visualizing?
- What insight you can get from your visualization?
